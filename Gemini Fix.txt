Fix Gemini AI Integration
The current implementation of Gemini AI in 
services/aiService.ts
 has potential issues with API key handling and hardcoded configuration. This plan outlines the steps to make it more robust and "out of the box" ready.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

API Key Configuration: The user must ensure VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY is set in their .env or 
.env.local
 file.

Proposed Changes
Services
[MODIFY] 
aiService.ts
Remove the hardcoded GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT constant that embeds the API key.
Refactor 
callGeminiApi
 to construct the endpoint URL dynamically, including the API key.
Add a check for the API key inside 
callGeminiApi
 and throw a clear error if it's missing.
(Optional) Allow model configuration, though gemini-pro is a reasonable default.
Change the default provider in 
generateResumeContent
 to 'gemini' to match the UI preference.
Verification Plan
Manual Verification
Check API Key: Ensure VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY is present in 
.env.local
.
Run Application: Start the app using npm run dev.
Generate Resume:
Navigate to the Editor.
Select "Gemini" as the provider (should be default).
Enter dummy text and click "Enhance".
Verify that the request is sent to the Gemini API and a response is received.
Check the browser console for any errors.
