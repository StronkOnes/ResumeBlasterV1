Resume Blaster: AI-Powered Resume Builder - No-Code Implementation Guide
1. Project Overview & Core Features
App Name: Resume Blaster
Core Value Proposition: An AI tool that transforms raw text or existing resumes into polished, professional documents optimized for ATS and human recruiters. Users can choose between a "No Hallucinations" mode (strictly factual) or an "AI Power Boost" mode (creative enhancement).

Key Functionalities:
Two Primary Modes:
Enhance & Optimize (No Hallucinations): Improves grammar, structure, and phrasing based only on the provided information.
Tailor & Power Boost (Hallucination Mode): Generates a "perfect 10/10" resume by inferring industry-standard skills, tools, and achievements based on the job title, even if not explicitly mentioned.
Input Methods: Upload a resume file (PDF, DOCX) OR paste text content.
Template Selection: Three distinct, visually appealing templates (excluding plain text).
Output Formats: Download as PDF, Word (.docx), or Google Docs link.
User Management: Free tier (3 resumes/month), Pro subscription ($8.99/month), and Pay-Per-Use ($14.99/resume).
Resume History: Save and manage up to 5 most recent resumes for free users; up to 10 for Pro users.
Backend: Supabase for authentication, database, and storage. Google Sheets for financial transaction logging (optional, for simplicity).
2. Tech Stack & Architecture
This architecture is designed for no-code platforms like Glide, Adalo, or Bubble. It prioritizes modularity so you can swap out the AI provider later.

Frontend UI
Glide / Adalo / Bubble
These are powerful no-code app builders with drag-and-drop interfaces, perfect for mobile and web.
Backend DB
Supabase
Free, open-source, provides PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, and Realtime APIs. Perfect for user profiles.
File Storage
Supabase Storage
Securely stores generated resumes (PDF, DOCX).
AI Engine
Qwen via Alibaba Cloud API
Your specified choice. Supabase can trigger functions that call external APIs.
Payment Gateway
Stripe
Industry standard, easy to integrate with Supabase and no-code tools for subscriptions and one-time fees.
Financial Log
Google Sheets
(via Zapier/Make.com)
Simple, auditable log for transactions. Can be replaced with a Supabase table later.
AI Prompting
Custom JSON Context Profile (based on
TheUltimateJSONContextPromptingGuideforChatGPT.pdf
)
Ensures consistent, high-quality, and controllable AI output.

Step 1: Create Supabase Project
Go to supabase.io and create a new project.
Note down your Project URL and API Key.
Step 2: Define Database Schema (Tables)
Table: users
id (UUID, Primary Key, Default: gen_random_uuid())
email (Text, Unique)
full_name (Text)
subscription_tier (Text, Default: 'free', Options: 'free', 'pro')
resume_count (Integer, Default: 0) // Tracks free tier usage
created_at (Timestamp, Default: now())
Table: resumes
id (UUID, Primary Key, Default: gen_random_uuid())
user_id (UUID, Foreign Key to users.id)
original_content (Text) // The raw text or parsed content from the uploaded file.
enhanced_content (Text) // The AI-generated, polished text.
template_selected (Text, e.g., 'modern', 'classic', 'executive')
enhancement_mode (Text, e.g., 'no_hallucination', 'hallucination')
file_path_pdf (Text) // Path to the stored PDF in Supabase Storage.
file_path_docx (Text) // Path to the stored DOCX in Supabase Storage.
generated_at (Timestamp, Default: now())
job_description_used (Text, Optional) // For tailoring feature.
Table: payments (Optional for initial version)

created_at (Timestamp)
Step 3: Configure Supabase Storage
In the Supabase dashboard, go to Storage.
Create a bucket named resumes.
Set public access rules to allow authenticated users to read and write their own files.
Step 4: Set Up Authentication
Enable Email/Password authentication in Supabase.
Configure the redirect URLs for your frontend app (e.g., https://yourapp.glideapp.io/callback).
5. AI Prompting Strategy: The JSON Context Profile for Qwen
This is the heart of your app. You will configure this prompt in your no-code tool's logic or via a Supabase Function. The goal is to give Qwen a clear, structured instruction set.

How to Implement the Prompt:
For No-Code Tools (Glide/Adalo/Bubble): Store this JSON as a variable or in a database record. When the user clicks "Generate," pass the user's input text, selected mode, and the full JSON profile to the AI service.
For Supabase Functions (Advanced): Create a serverless function that receives the user's data, constructs the full prompt, calls the Qwen API, and returns the result.
6. Integrating Qwen via Alibaba Cloud API
Step 1: Get Qwen API Access
Sign up for an Alibaba Cloud account.
Navigate to the Model Studio and find the Qwen model (e.g., qwen-max or qwen-plus).
Obtain your API Key and Endpoint URL.
Step 2: Call the API from Your App
The no-code tool will need to make an HTTP POST request to the Qwen endpoint. Here’s the basic structure:

http


1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
POST https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/api/v1/services/aigc/text-generation-generation/text-generation/invoke
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "qwen-max",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "Your full JSON Context Profile + User Input Text"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "max_tokens": 2048,
    "temperature": 0.7
  }
}
Important: The prompt field should contain the entire JSON context profile string, followed by the user's raw resume text. You might need to concatenate them.
Error Handling: Ensure your app handles API errors gracefully (e.g., rate limits, invalid keys).
7. Financial Transaction System
Option 1: Stripe Integration (Recommended)
Sign up for a Stripe account.
In your no-code tool, use its built-in Stripe integration to create:
A Product for the monthly Pro subscription ($8.99).
A Product for the one-time boost ($14.99).
Link these products to your Supabase users table. When a payment succeeds, update the subscription_tier and reset resume_count.
Option 2: Google Sheets Logging (Simpler)
Create a Google Sheet with columns: User ID, Email, Amount, Type (Subscription/One-Time), Status, Date.
Use Zapier or Make.com to connect your no-code app's payment events to this sheet.
Manually reconcile payments with Supabase user data.
8. Generating and Downloading Files
Step 1: Convert Text to PDF/DOCX
For No-Code Tools: Most platforms have built-in actions to generate PDFs from text or HTML. Use the enhanced text output from Qwen.
For Supabase: You can use a serverless function with a library like pdf-lib or docx to convert the text into a file and save it to Supabase Storage.
Step 2: Provide Download Links
After generating the file, store its path in the resumes table (file_path_pdf, file_path_docx).
In your frontend, when the user clicks "Download," construct a URL like https://[your-supabase-project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/resumes/[file_path] and initiate the download.
